# Police Activity Analytics
## Overview:

This project explores the "Stanford Open Policing Project" dataset and analyzes the impact of gender, race, violation type, timing of pulling over, weather and location on police behavior and hence on interaction outcome.

**Some of the questiones that I explored were:**

* whether male and female drivers tend to commit different types of traffic violations.
* does gender affect who gets a ticket for speeding or search rates?
* does gender affect whether driver gets frisked?
* are drug-related stops becoming more common over time?
* If one were to be stopped for a particular violation, how long might one expect to be detained?
* do search rates or arrest rates vary with the weather conditions?

## Packages:
**Python Version:** 3.7
