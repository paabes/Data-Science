# London-Apartament-Price-Estimation

The aim of this project was to create a regression model, which would later be deployed to a simple flask server.

Importing & cleaning data, feature engineering, dimentionality reduction, outlier removlal, bulding, tuning, performance evaluation and storage of model is done in model/MLApp.ipynb

server/server.py contains flask server configuration, while client directory handles front-end matters.
