I was engaged throughout and definitely enjoyed my time spent reading it.I loved the character development in this novel.  Da Silva creates a cast of high school students who actually act like high school students.  I really appreciated the fact that none of them were thrown into situations far beyond their years, nor did they deal with events as if they had decades of life experience under their belts.  It was very refreshing and added to the realism and impact of the novel.  The friendships between the characters in this novel were also truly touching.Overall, this novel was fantastic.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more and to find out what happens next in the series.

Even we baby-boomers have huge gaps in our knowledge of World War II - Unbroken fills in gaps and brings it home to the reader. I recommend it to readers of all ages. Our fathers and grandfathers who fought this war didn't think they were doing anything but their job.  Those, like Louie, who became POWs, found courage they never thought they'd have. As I read this, I wondered what I would have done in his place. I read this book in two sittings.\""
