# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview:

What exactly is Customer Churn? It is when an existing customer, user, player, subscriber or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company. It can be defined in a variety of ways.

* **Contractual Churn** or when a customer is under contract for a service and decides to cancel their service. This can be found in Cable TV, and SaaS products.

* **Voluntary Churn** is when a user voluntarily cancels a service and includes Prepaid Cell Phones, Streaming Subsriptions.

* **Non-Contractual** or when a customer is not under contract for a service is the next example of churn, and includes consumer loyalty at a retail location or online browsing.

* Finally, **involuntary churn**, or when a churn occurs not at the request of the customer and includes, credit card expiration, or utilties being shut off by the provider.

Here, churn is defined by the customer cancelling their cellular plan at a given point in time and is encoded in the dataset as no / yes. The aim of this project is to preprocess and analyze a real-world cellular service usage dataset to evaluate which variables are biggest drivers for the customer churn, then create, evaluate and tune classification models that will be able to predict potential churn efficiently based on users' activity.
